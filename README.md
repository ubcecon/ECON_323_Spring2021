# Course materials for ECON 323, Spring 2021

Previous **programming experience** and classwork is useful but **not required**. But even if you know how to program, you will learn a great deal of interesting applications.

We will follow the [QuantEcon DataScience](https://datascience.quantecon.org/) textbook

## Computational Setup

You will not need to install any software on your local computer.  Instead:
- Go to the [QuantEcon DataScience Introduction](https://datascience.quantecon.org/introduction/)
- One time setup: click on the "Settings" icon at the bottom of a lecture and choose the server: [ubc.syzygy.ca](ubc.syzygy.ca)
- Then click on the "Launch Notebook" to launch any notebook in your computing environment
- See [Troubleshooting](https://datascience.quantecon.org/introduction/troubleshooting.html) for how to reset notebooks, etc.
- We strongly suggest creating a GitHub account and signing up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack/)

If possible, please bring a laptop to class to interactively discuss the material.
